The accessible coding practices resources provides tools, rules, techniques and examples to help web developers understand how to make their websites more accessible to people with disabilities.
The resources of the website are developed through the work of the Open Accessibility Alliance and the Open Ajax Accessibility Task Force.


h2. Rulesets

* A collection of rules that support accessibility and the implementation of W3C WCAG 2.0 requirements
* Rulesets contain both required and recommended rules
* Ruleset differ in the rules and rules that are required based on the accessibility goals and skills of the developers

h2. Rules

* Rules are used to test the accessibility features of a website 
* Rules identify the coding techniques that can used to satisfy the rule requirements
* Rules can result in violations (i.e. required rules fail), warnings (i.e. recommended rule fails), manual checks or pass

h2. Examples

* Examples demonstrate techniques that can be used to satisfy rule requirements
* Examples include information on assistive technology compatibility

h2. Markup

* Markup provides information on how a particular element or attribute may related to a rule or example

h2. Tools

* Open source tools that are freely avaible that support the rulesets and rules found in the coding practice resources

* The purpose of accessible web coding practices website is to document the design patterns and the HTML/CSS/ARIA coding practices that lead to web resources being accessible and usable by people with disabilities.
* The rules and techniques in the coding practices resources and tools differ from the techniques and requirements of WCAG 2.0 in that the coding practice resources and tools emphesize both usability and accessibility, this to both improve accessibility of web resources to people with disabilities and to simplify explaining accessibility requirements to developers.  The legalistic "how to meet" sections of WCAG 2.0 often require complex logic to factor out usability concerns to interpret how to apply WCAG 2.0 requirements to a web resource to verify technical compliance.  If you are more concerned with technical compliance to WCAG 2.0 than with creating usable resources for people with disbabilities you may want to seek other resources to help you in your evaluation.
* The organization of the web site is based upon both the organization of the W3C "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0":http://www.w3.org/tr/wcag and rule categories based on "HTML4":http:/www.w3.org/tr/html4 and "HTML5":http://www.w3.org/tr/html5 element types.  The rule category organization is often more useful to web developers and designers trying to understand the techniques and requirements for making web content more accessible.
* The web site is based on the "OpenAjax Accesisbility Evaluation Library Rules":http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/Accessibility for evaluting the accessibility of web resources.
* The resources are being developed as a collaboration of the "OpenAjax Accessibility Task Force":http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/Accessibility and the "Open Accessibility Alliance":http://collaborate.athenpro.org/group/open-accessibility-alliance/ .
